- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I was able to learn about the use of multiple flexboxes in a single container. I was also able to revise about the use of the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class selector.
In Javascript I was able to revise some functions like making an element, adding properties to it and appending it to the DOM.

```js
document.createElement();
element.classList.add();
document.appendChild();
```

### Continued development

I am still not comfortable with the use of flex-boxes and the properties used in it like align-items and align-content. I will continue to practice and learn more about it.

### Useful resources

- [Learn about n-th child](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) - Use this website to learn about the use of nth-child used in CSS and various values that can be used with it.
